# Hello-World
drills and excercises from the book Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup, 2nd Edition - May 25, 2014) (updated for C++11/C++14) 


The only thing used to create the files in the Hello World project at the moment is vim in a GNOME Terminal to create the .cpp files and g++ to make an executable .out file.

the custom header file std_lib_facilities.h can be found at www.stroustrup.com/Programming/std_lib_facilities.h. It provides the most common standard headers (in the global namespace) and minimal exception/error support.

Note: the g++ command is a GNU c++ compiler invocation command, which is used for preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking of source code to generate an executable file. The choice to use g++ was arbitrary.
